# About the Project

## Task

The goal of the project is to implement a simple page that
- displays a sectioned list of the dogs with basic information about them,
- allows to group elements by different categories (name, company, country),
- allows filtering of the items based on the given filter and selected category.

For styling of the page was used Chakra UI component library. Also some basic tests are introduced.
